# Gameplay Feature Checklist

Use this before finishing a gameplay task.

## Code

- component data-only
- system owns behavior
- correct shared/server/client placement
- `On... -> Try... -> Can... -> Do...` flow where applicable

## Data

- prototypes updated if serialized fields or content tuning changed
- visuals or sound collections updated if the feature needs them
- SD-only additions placed under `_SD` when appropriate, or under the existing inherited/vendor subtree that owns the feature

## Text

- every player-facing string localized
- `en-US` updated in the same pass, with `ru-RU` updated when the touched feature already maintains it or the wording is known

## Validation

- build or targeted tests run
- YAML linter run for prototype or FTL changes
- runtime or in-game verification called out if not possible
