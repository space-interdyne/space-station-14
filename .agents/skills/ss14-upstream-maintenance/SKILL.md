description: Safely maintain a forked SS14 codebase with minimal upstream churn. Use when deciding whether to edit upstream files, when extending behavior in `_SD` or an existing inherited fork/module subtree, when preserving path similarity, or when avoiding unnecessary changes to RobustToolbox and inherited content.

# SS14 Upstream Maintenance

Use this skill whenever a change touches inherited upstream code or may introduce avoidable fork drift.

## Workflow

1. Open `references/edit-strategy.md`.
2. Open `references/engine-boundaries.md` before considering engine or broad upstream edits.
3. Open `references/edit-types.md` for the expected fork-edit patterns.
4. Open `references/path-similarity.md` when adding fork-side files.
5. Open `references/fork-only-content.md` when `_SD` or another existing fork/module subtree may be the right home.
6. Prefer the smallest diff that solves the task.
7. Treat `RobustToolbox/` as off-limits unless the task explicitly requires engine work and no content-side path will solve it.
8. Mirror existing folder paths when adding fork-side extensions.
9. Prefer reusable extensions and public APIs over one-off branches, special cases, or hardcoded fork behavior.
10. Mark SD-specific blocks in inherited files outside the owning `_SD` subtree when the local style uses edit markers or the change would otherwise be hard to identify.
