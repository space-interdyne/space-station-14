# SS14 Server

Use this when editing `Content.Server/`.

- Load `ss14-ecs-components`, `ss14-ecs-entities`, `ss14-ecs-systems`, and `ss14-tests-authoring` as needed.
- Keep authority, persistence, and round rules on the server.
- Put SD-only server systems under `Content.Server/_SD/`.
- If the player should feel the result immediately, make sure the shared prediction path is not missing.
- Keep server changes paired with prototypes and locale when player-facing behavior changes.
